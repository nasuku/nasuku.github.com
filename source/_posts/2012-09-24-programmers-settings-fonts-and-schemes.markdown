Being a software person, a fair chunk of my life is spent before the
computer. Which translates to the feeling that I should be very comfortable
doing my routing tasks with it - The most common task being reading whats
shown on the screen..

I consider that Fonts play a very important role in this. A font for a
programmer need not by stylish (like the newspaper fonts) but should have
the following properties.

1. It should be fixed width. Some folks may disagree on this when they use
   some very modern editors. But Readbility when there are
   nested code blocks is great if the font is fixed width.
2. The font should cleanly identify the difference between similar looking
   letters of alphabet - Especially l and 1. or 0 and O.
   imagine the case if your code has variables like ```var1``` and ```varl```
   and you are trying to debug the code and you need to strain your eyes
   just to distinguish between l and 1.

My favorite fonts for this reason are:

+ [Cousine](http://openfontlibrary.org/font/cousine)
+ [Anonymous Pro](http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html)
+ Monaco (available on mac by default)
+ Consolas (available on windows 7 by default)

I used all 4 of the fonts above and keep switching between them once in a
while - All of them are equally good and way better than many other
monospace fonts.


Next important aspect for a programmer is the color scheme. It should not
strain your eyes too much. This is a very personal taste ofcourse.

My favories are

* [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
* [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/)
