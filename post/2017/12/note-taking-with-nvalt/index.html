				<p>I always used to write tidbits of programming or notes in a file in electronic format and refer to them frequently.
Over a span of few montsh this would grow to be a big file that becomes invaluable to me and I end up referring it again and again.
A Simple text file with a simple delimiter like &mdash; or ### would have done to job but not always easy to search.</p>
<p>On macos, I came across this nice piece of tool called <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt">nvalt</a>.
This enables me to write new content as well as search in the pervious content with ease.</p>
